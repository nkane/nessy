// dapAttached counts active DAP sessions. The game loop checks this
// before stepping the CPU — when one or more clients are attached,
// the server's `continue` runLoop owns execution and the game loop
// only paints frames. nil → no client → autonomous run.
//
// Package-level since there is one game per process. The counter is
// atomic because OnAttached / OnDisconnected fire from the DAP
// session goroutine while the game loop reads from the Ebiten Update
// goroutine.
var dapAttached atomic.Int32

// waitForAttach blocks the game loop's CPU stepping at boot when
// nessy was launched under `chippy -nessy …`. Set by main from the
// -wait-for-debugger flag BEFORE the DAP listener starts so a fast
// client attach can't lose the race. Cleared the first time a DAP
// client actually attaches (OnAttached fires).
//
// Note this is a one-shot gate: once cleared we don't re-arm on
// disconnect. The user has confirmed they're driving the debugger;
// closing the TUI shouldn't suddenly restart the game.
var waitForAttach atomic.Bool

// runDAPListener accepts incoming DAP connections on the given TCP port
// and serves each one against the live NES bus. The cpuMu is shared
// with the Ebiten game loop so concurrent requests never observe a
// mid-instruction register snapshot. Same pattern chippy uses behind
// `:dap PORT` (internal/tui/dap_attach.go) — see issue #97 for design
// notes.
//
// OnAttached / OnDisconnected callbacks increment / decrement
// `dapAttached`. The game loop checks that counter to decide whether
// to step the CPU. When a client attaches, the server's runLoop (set
// up by `continue`) becomes the sole stepper; the game loop yields.
// When the last client disconnects, the game loop resumes its
// autonomous run.
